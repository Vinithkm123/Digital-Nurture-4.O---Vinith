## Define SPA and its Benefits
SPA (Single Page Application):
A web application that loads a single HTML page and updates content dynamically without refreshing the whole page.

Benefits of SPA:
Faster user experience after first load.
Reduces server load since only data (not full pages) is transferred.
Smooth navigation without full-page reloads.

##Define React and Explain How It Works
React:
A JavaScript library for building fast, interactive user interfaces.

How React Works:
React breaks your UI into small reusable pieces called components. It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the page that change, making the app fast.

##Differences Between SPA and MPA
Feature	SPA (Single Page Application)	MPA (Multi Page Application)
Page Load	Loads once, content updates dynamically	Loads a new page for each request
Speed	Faster after first load	Slower due to full page reloads
Navigation	Smooth, no page refresh	Traditional, with page reloads
Example	Gmail, Facebook	Amazon, Flipkart (older versions)

##Pros & Cons of SPA
Pros:

Fast and responsive after initial load.

Reusable components.

Better user experience.

Cons:

SEO challenges (since itâ€™s a single page).

Initial load can be slow.

Requires JavaScript to work.

##Define Virtual DOM
Virtual DOM:
A lightweight copy of the real DOM (Document Object Model).
React uses this virtual DOM to track changes and update only the necessary parts of the page, making updates much faster.

##Features of React
Component-based architecture.

Uses Virtual DOM for fast rendering.

One-way data binding.

Reusable and modular code.

Supports hooks (for using state and lifecycle features).

Easy to integrate with other libraries.

Steps to Create React App
